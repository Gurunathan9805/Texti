Electric Vehicle Evolution Dashboard (1997 - 2024)
Overview
This dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of the evolution of electric vehicles (EVs) from 1997 to 2024. It offers insights into key developments, technological advancements, market trends, policy changes, and consumer adoption patterns over this period. The dashboard is designed to serve researchers, policymakers, automotive industry stakeholders, and enthusiasts interested in understanding the trajectory of EVs.

### step1
#### Milestones: 
Major milestones in the EV industry, including the launch of significant models, technological breakthroughs, and important policy changes.
#### Timeline Visualization: 
An interactive timeline that allows users to explore key events year by year.
#### Battery Technology: 
Evolution of battery technology, including improvements in energy density, cost, and charging times.
#### Motor Efficiency: 
Advancements in electric motor efficiency and performance.
#### Autonomy and Connectivity: 
Developments in autonomous driving technology and vehicle connectivity.

### Step2
Import the data from excelsheet and tranform the data what we are using in this dashboard

Remove unwanted data and columns in the dataset

### step3
Download the additional visuals like paly axis, animated bar chart race and aster plot.

### step4
First plot the animated bar chart with the column fill of Make, Sum of Electric range and Period
